# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator is designed to be the simplest way to create and read flashcards in your terminal. 

There are two commands: 

1) CREATE 

	This allows you to create two different types of flashcards. 


	- Basic Flashcard: 
	
	  You will be prompted to enter a question, followed by an answer.

	  Example:

	  Why are flamingos pink?
	  They eat shrimp


	- Cloze-Deleted Flashcards: 
		
	  You will be prompted to enter the text portion of the flashcard. At this 
 	  stage, be sure to include three dots (“...”) to indicate where the deleted portion of the text 
	  should be in the text. An error message will be displayed if you do not include the "..." in your text. 

	  Then, you will be prompted to enter the deleted-portion (or missing piece) of the text.

	  Example: 

	  Eli ... is the QB for the NY Giants.
	  Manning

	  In 1972, ... won his second academy award for best male actor.
	  Marlon Brando

2) READ

	This allows you to a) read all of the cards you have created (basic & cloze-deleted) and b) provide 
	the answers to each flashcard.
	
	If you are correct, you will be presented with a “Good Work!” message. 
	If you are incorrect, you will have the option to view the correct answer. Simply press 'Enter'. 
	Conversely, you may skip this step by pressing 'n' followed by the 'Enter' key.
