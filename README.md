# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator is designed to be the simplest way to create and read flashcards in your terminal. 

There are two commands: 

1) CREATE 

	This allows you to create two different types of flashcards. 


	- Basic Flashcard: 
	
	  You will be prompted to enter a question, followed by the answer.


	- Cloze-Deleted Flashcards: 
		
	  You will be prompted to enter the text portion of the flashcard. At this 
 	  stage, be sure to include three dots (“. . .”) to indicate where the deleted portion of the text 
	  should go in the text. An error message will display if you do not include the three dots in your text. 

	  Then, you will be prompted to enter the deleted-portion (or missing piece) of the text.

2) READ

	This allows you to read all of the cards you have created (basic & cloze-delted) and to provide the answer.
	If you are correct, you will be presented with a “Good Work!” message. 
	If you are incorrect, you will have the option to view the correct answer. Simply press Enter. 
	You may also skip this step by pressing “n” followed by the Enter key. 

Hope you enjoy!
